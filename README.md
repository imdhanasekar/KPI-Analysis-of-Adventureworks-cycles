# KPI analysis of Adventureworks cycles company with Power BI

Welcome to the AdventureWorks Database Analysis and Visualization project! 

## Project Overview 
This project aims to provide insights and visualizations into the AdventureWorks database, which is a sample database provided by Microsoft for learning and testing purposes.

The AdventureWorks database contains data related to a bicycle manufacturer, including information on products, sales, customers, and employees. In this project, I used Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize the data in order to gain a better understanding of the business operations of AdventureWorks.
